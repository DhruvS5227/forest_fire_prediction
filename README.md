# forest_fire_prediction

We will prepare the respective model which will successfully predict the hotspot of the forest fire using Geographical image Analysis (GIA) and various Machine learning/Supervised Learning algorithms to develop an information and decision support system to monitor and predict forest fire activity, and to enhance fire management efficiency.
